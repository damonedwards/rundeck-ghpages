      <p>Rundeck is a great alternative and gives you features you are used to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A web portal for self service or centralized administration.
        </li>
        <li>A pluggable way to execute remote commands and scripts.
        </li>
        <li>Multi-step job workflows with error handling and notification.
        </li>
        <li>Enables writing automation with variables that reference data from an infrastructure model using sources like files, or other tools (like Chef or Puppet) or your custom CMDB.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>How is Rundeck different than ControlTier?</h4>
      <p>While sharing some roots and philosophy, Rundeck has matured into a
        tool that complements other tools.         
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>Small footprint</i>. Agent-less (via ssh/winrm). Works with third party repositories like
          yum, Nexus, Artifactory.
        </li>
        <li><i>Simpler</i>. Devleloping automation with Rundeck is generally
          easier than ControlTier. This is partly due to the fact that Rundeck
          is Node oriented rather than the complexity of ControlTier's Sites and
          Services type/object model.
        </li>
      </ul>

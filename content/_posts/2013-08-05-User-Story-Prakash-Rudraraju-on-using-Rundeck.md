<p>We are launching a case study series called "Rundeck User Stories" sponsored by <a href="http://simplifyops.com" target="_blank">SimplifyOps</a>. We want to give users in the Rundek a community a platform to tell others how and why they are using Rundeck. On top of that, we just love talking to Rundeck users and seeing what they are up to!</p>

<p>Exciting announcement posted today to <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rundeck-discuss/4duTcFKpXIg">Rundeck-Discuss</a>... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello Rundeck community,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SimplifyOps is proud to announce RUNDECK PRO.  It is a turnkey solution for enterprise Rundeck usage.  RUNDECK PRO subscribers get all of the standard Rundeck features as well as a supported and tested enterprise configuration. RUNDECK PRO is a commercial offering that comes bundled with support from the core Rundeck team.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is all about making life easier for the Rundeck administrators out there. RUNDECK PRO should provide you with peace of mind and free up your time to focus on building automation, helping others get started with Rundeck, and other value-adding tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Is the Rundeck project license changing?</h3>
<p>No. RUNDECK PRO is built on the same open source Rundeck code that is available from the Rundeck community. Your end-users who write and run jobs shouldn’t notice much difference. RUNDECK PRO is about administering and scaling Rundeck. RUNDECK PRO ensures that everything you need is tested, configured, and supported for enterprise production use. RUNDECK PRO users get the dual benefits of a fast-moving community project and a tested, production-ready product. The broader Rundeck community also benefits from RUNDECK PRO because the subscription fees will help us fund more engineers so we can push the project forward even faster. If anything, you’ll see more innovation going on inside the Rundeck open source project</p>

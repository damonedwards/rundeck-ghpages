A plugin thats similar to the other Slack Notification plugins that are out there, except for a different platform.

This is for Rocket.Chat (https://rocket.chat) which is a competitor to Slack and it's becoming quite large in the ChatOps space.

It allows you to receive notifications to custom rooms using the Start, Finished, Failed notifications available in RunDeck jobs.

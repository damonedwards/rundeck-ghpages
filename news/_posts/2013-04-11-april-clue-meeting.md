<p class="lead">Will Sterling gave a presentation introducing Rundeck at the April Clue Meeting.</p>
<p>
If you are new to Rundeck, <a href="http://vimeo.com/63795340">watch Will give an 
introduction</a> to what Rundeck can do and how he uses it to automate
work at DataLogix.
</p>
<p>Here are some notable quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
"Multi-tentant command orchestration and process automation with WebGUI, CLI, and RESTful API."
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
"Target nodes with rich metadata. Never use hostnames again."
</li>
<li>
"Process automation via multi-step jobs...Options allow users to pick one or more values."
</li>
<li>
"Rundeck makes everything in the GUI available through the API."
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Besides showing off the basics, Will opened up Eclipse to step through ruby code that talks to Puppet to communicate node information to Rundeck. His code only includes nodes he can ping and have a certain class.
</p>
<p>
Will also showed off how he uses <a href="https://github.com/micha/resty">resty</a> as nice shell based way to access the Rundeck API.

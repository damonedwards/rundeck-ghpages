<p>Another Rundeck case study is up. This time it's Jordan Koch on <a href="http://rundeck.org/stories/jordan_koch_disney.html">how Disney is using Rundeck to enable self-service operations</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to give users in the Rundek a community a platform to tell others how and why they are using Rundeck. On top of that, we just love talking to Rundeck users! <a href="mailto:damon@simplifyops.com?subject=Rundeck User Story">Email me</a> so we can include your story.</p>

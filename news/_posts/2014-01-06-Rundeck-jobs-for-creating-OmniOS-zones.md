<p>A user from the community, Frédéric Alix, created a nice video about how he uses Rundeck to create OmniOS zones on-demand. On his blog, <a href="http://blog.fredalix.com/2014/01/rundeck-create-omnios-zones.html">Frederic's World</a>, he has a link to a project archive containing the jobs used in this video.</p>

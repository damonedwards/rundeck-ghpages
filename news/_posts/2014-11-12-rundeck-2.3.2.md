**Notes from 2.3.0 Release**

* Improved support for use of Windows, both as a Rundeck server 
    and a remote node.
    * Fixed outstanding issues with CLI .bat scripts
    * Support powershell scripts by allowing configuration
        of file extension to be used in workflow script steps. 
        E.g use ".ps1" because powershell will not execute a script 
        that doesn't end in .ps1.
    * Other fixes for issues with script-based plugins and Windows paths.
* Added support for storing Passwords in the Key Storage facility.  
    The built-in SSH execution and SCP file copy 
    both now support using stored passwords.
    Note: the Key Storage facility is not encrypted by default, see
    [Key Storage](http://rundeck.org/docs/administration/key-storage.html).
* Added a new GUI for uploading Passwords and public/private keys
    to the Key Storage facility
* Bug fixes
* Disable SSLv3 by default

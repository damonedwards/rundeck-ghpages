<p>Recently, we've been getting a lot of interest in and feedback on <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/job-scheduler/">Rundeck's job scheduling capabilities</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people tell us that they are using Rundeck as a job scheduler where there was none before. Others tell us that they are using Rundeck to replace their expensive and cumbersome legacy job schedulers. In any case, it's clear that people are enjoying Rundeck as a job scheduler and are wanting more of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are going to be putting significant effort into improving Rundeck's job scheduling capabilities during upcoming releases. Issues like <a href="https://github.com/rundeck/rundeck/issues/830">#830</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rundeck/rundeck/issues/906">#906</a> are obvious places to start. Beyond that, we are looking to gather as much community feedback and guidance as possible. </p>

<p>A new whitepaper by Rundeck community member John Becker has caught our eye. <a href="https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/privilege/introduction-rundeck-secure-script-executions-37162" target="_blank">"Introduction to Rundeck for Secure Script Executions"</a> &#40;PDF&#41; is available in the <a href="https://www.sans.org/reading-room/" target="_blank">InfoSec Reading Room</a>, a treasure trove of academic-style security whitepapers made available for free by the SANS Institute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to a solid introduction to Rundeck and some of Becker's usage tips, the paper discusses how to use Rundeck to provide least privaleged access over the sprawl of tools that operations organizations use today. There is a great example towards the end of the paper where Becker illustrates how to use Rundeck to improve incident response &#40;specifically the preparation, identification, and containment phases&#41;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This paper is a good read whether you are new to Rundeck or a seasoned veteran.</p>

### Rundeck 2.0 

<p>We are extremely pleased to announce the first general release of Rundeck 2.0. For those who haven't seen the 2.0.0 in its alpha and beta releases, prepare yourself for a vastly improved Rundeck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While this is our first general release of 2.0, we are not done yet. We have more exciting ideas and features brewing that you'll see in 2014. Many thanks to the Rundeck community for their ideas, feedback, and inspiration.</p>

### Where to download
Various download methods are available. Please visit the Downloads page: <http://rundeck.org/downloads.html>

### Try it as a demo

You can try Rundeck 2 in the context of two working examples. Both examples use vagrant to bring up a working Rundeck server with a project and jobs already set up. 

* The “anvils” demo: <https://github.com/rundeck/anvils-demo>
* The basic training example: <https://github.com/simplifyops/training-service-oriented>

To see Rundeck 2, install Vagrant, checkout one of the repos and run “vagrant up”.

<p>Another Rundeck case study is up. This time it's the folks from <a href="../stories/salesforce_gigantor.html">Salesforce.com showing how they use Rundeck.</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We want to give users in the Rundek a community a platform to tell others how and why they are using Rundeck. On top of that, we just love talking to Rundeck users! <a href="mailto:damon@simplifyops.com?subject=Rundeck User Story">Email me</a> if you would like to be featured.</p>

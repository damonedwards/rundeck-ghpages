### Get an early look at Rundeck 2.0 

We are excited to announce Rundeck 2.0.0-beta1. This is the second preview release of Rundeck 2.0. The purpose of this release is to continue to gather feedback and get input from as many users as possible.

Most of the work done in 2.0 development focuses on two areas:
1. Providing a more professional and polished user experience for the many Rundeck users whose primary use case is providing self-service operations and helping their teams collaborate.
2. Upgrades and enhancements to Rundeck's core and development stack in order to improve performance, reduce development overhead, and prepare for upcoming features requested by the community

Your feedback really counts at this stage. We have set up our Trello board to help you leave comments and vote on changes (<https://trello.com/b/sn3g9nOr/rundeck-development>).
